22:48 <@kushal> use google.com to find out how to add package dependencies in your setup.py file
22:49 <@kushal> and create a new project, make that setup.py and other files properly, submit it to the test PyPI server (remember, the test server)
22:50 <@kushal> and then submit a home task post with the link of the project in test PyPi
22:50 <@kushal> title of the post: "dummy project"
22:50 <@kushal> btw, missed one point
22:51 <@kushal> in the dummy project, one should have a command myshell (remember that shell I asked to write few days back ?)
22:52 <@kushal> remember to test the project using pip :)
22:54 < Armageddon> what test server ?
22:54 <@kushal> Armageddon, PyPi test server
22:54 <@kushal> Armageddon, http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/projectstructure.html#registering-your-project
http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/projectstructure.html#python-package-index-pypi
22:56 <@kushal> you have 2 days for the submission :)
22:59 <@kushal> remember to rename the file myshell.py to myshell


23:11 <@kushal> btw, two links to read: www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html www.paulgraham.com/avg.html
