22:33 < kushal> please read file and functions chapter
22:34 < kushal> and then write a file called, mount.py
22:34 < kushal> if we execute it like $ ./mount.py
22:34 < kushal> it should give the same output as mount command
22:34 < kushal> /proc/mounts is file you need to read for the same
22:35 < kushal> name of the problem is "mount"
22:35 < kushal> so remember to create a directory called mount in your git repository and solution.rst there
22:36 < kushal> explain your code properly in that solution.rst
22:36 < kushal> also give a link to your actual code file in github.com
22:38 < kushal> http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/quickstart.html for rst help
22:44 < kushal> first push the directory and then submit the solution
22:44 < kushal> remember to explain properly
22:44 < kushal> you can do lots of comments in the source too
