Introduction
--------------

Hi, my name is Shungoh Kaetsu. 
I'm interested in learing python programming language.
I'm also interested in FLOSS world.
I'd like to learn how people communicate in a community and
want to be a part of community member in future.

I'm quite new to the tools like IRC, Git and Mailing list.
So it's a good opportunity for me to learn basic usage and netiquette. I'm enjoying the training so far.
