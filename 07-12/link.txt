22:21 < kushal> everyone can skip http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/igd.html and then read the virtualenv and project structure chapter
22:23 < kushal> for the next assignment
22:24 < kushal> everyone needs to write the commands they will use in the shell
22:26 < kushal> you have to create and use a virtualenv
22:26 < kushal> name it whatever you want
22:27 < kushal> write a file called, planetparser.py
22:28 < kushal> when we run it, like $ ./planetparser.py
22:28 < kushal> it should print each of the blog post name, author name on the terminal
22:29 < kushal> feel free to use any available python module for the same
22:29 < kushal> install them in your virtualenv, that is why you have to copy paste the commands you ise
22:29 < kushal> use
22:29 < kushal> so that we can find out exact details about the packages
22:30 < kushal> you have the whole weekend for this task
22:30 < kushal> ^^ any question related to the assignment ?
22:30 < kushal> btw, do not rush
22:30 < kushal> take your time
22:30 < kushal> do enough search to find the module which will help you the most
22:31 < kushal> there are different ways to do the same
22:34 < kushal> http://planet.fedoraproject.org/
22:35 < kushal> open this link
22:35 < kushal> and see the blog posts
22:36 < kushal> so you have to print the blog post titles and author names
22:38 < J_Caselles_> Yes. I didn't understand the hole thing about shell commands and virtualenv
22:38 < kushal> J_Caselles_, say to create a virtualenv you have to give a command, $ virtualenv myenv
22:38 < kushal> J_Caselles_, you should copy paste $ virtualenv myenv
22:38 < kushal> in the solution.rst
22:39 < kushal> so that we can understand what exactly you did
22:41 < anuragk> kushal: the blog posts particularly on that specific page of the site, right?
22:42 < kushal> anuragk, yes, but remember there are many ways
