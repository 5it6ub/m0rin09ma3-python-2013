22:05 < kushal> next task, read about classes and modules
22:07 < kushal> after that , read about http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html
22:09 < kushal> now the hometask, for which you have to read that urllib2 module
22:12 < kushal> http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=GOOG&f=l1
22:12 < kushal> ^^^ try that url
22:12 < kushal> there we are passing GOOG

22:14 < kushal> now, name of the hometask: "sharevalue", name of the code, sharevalue.py
22:14 < kushal>  ./sharevalue.py GOOG
22:14 < kushal> ^^ the above should print the latest share value of GOOD
