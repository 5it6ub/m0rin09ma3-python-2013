21:46 < kushal> we build a small web app
21:47 < kushal> we will start small and then slowly go over
21:48 < kushal> we will use flask
21:48 < kushal> if anyone missed, he/she can read http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/flask.html as a start
21:49 < kushal> now the first task
21:50 < kushal> everyone, create a new directory in their git, call it logviewer
21:51 < kushal> in the index page (/) of the app, it will show different available logs, to start just show by log names
21:52 < kushal> by clicking the log name, it will open a new page which will show the log
21:52 < kushal> so the urls will look like
21:53 < kushal> http://localhost:8000/ -- > will show all logs
21:54 < kushal> http://localhost:8000/log/id_of_the_log --> will show the actual log
21:54 < kushal> in the source directory, create a directory called "posts"
21:55 < kushal> and inside keep some training logs
21:55 < kushal> point to remember: logs should be kept not just as plain text file
21:56 < kushal> but something like a json file, where you can store, log name, date-time, full log text etc
21:57 < kirk_iowa> my logs (say of #dgplug channel) are one continuous file.  is that a problem?  do i need to break it up into daily pieces, for example ?
21:58 < kushal> kirk_iowa, break it up, this is just home task so not have to be full classes, but just first 20-50 lines from each class
21:58 < kushal> kirk_iowa, or you can just download them from dgplug site
21:58 < kushal> it can be any year
22:02 < kushal> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/29482/ shows one way to store data
22:03 < kushal> so, you have to design the store of data first
22:03 < kushal> and then write some script/something to save some data in the store
22:03 < kushal> and then start working on the web app
22:04 < kushal> and you should discuss your ideas with others here


>>> logs = []
>>> log = {'name':'Python Session 1', 'date': 'somedate','text':'<a>: Hello\n<b>: Bye'}
>>> logs.append(log)
>>> import json
>>> json.dump # use this with logs :)
